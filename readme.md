# Perch Bootstrap
A very simple framework for building websites using [Perch](http://grabaperch.com) based on my [website bootstrap](). Although I use this for Perch there's no reason it can't be used for any other PHP application.

## Setup
1. Clone this repo.
2. Go [buy a perch license](https://grabaperch.com/buy) and copy the Perch application files to repo/perch.
3. Follow the Perch [installation instructions](http://support.grabaperch.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&id=3).

## License
There is none! Do what you like - use it edit it, distribute it as your own (this excludes the parts which are not mine, e.g. Andy Clarke's ie6.css which are subject to their own licenses).
